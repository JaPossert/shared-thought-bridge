## Development Progress

### âœ… COMPLETED
**Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Authentication**
- âœ… Database schema (profiles, privacy_settings, data_sources, content_summaries, collaboration_sessions)
- âœ… Authentication system (assumed in place)
- âœ… Google Drive OAuth2 integration  
- âœ… Logseq file upload processing
- âœ… Basic AI content summarization & topic extraction

**Phase 2: Privacy Controls (JUST COMPLETED)**
- âœ… Privacy settings interface with content sharing preferences
- âœ… Topic exclusion management system
- âœ… File pattern exclusion rules
- âœ… Data retention controls
- âœ… Topic approval/rejection system with bulk operations
- âœ… Content categorization framework

### ðŸš§ NEXT UP (say "continue" to proceed)
**Phase 3: AI Processing & Embeddings Enhancement**
- [ ] Add OpenAI embeddings generation to content processing
- [ ] Implement semantic similarity comparison system
- [ ] Add content hashing for privacy
- [ ] Create automatic data deletion based on retention settings
- [ ] Build embedding-based topic clustering

**Phase 4: Collaboration & Matching Engine**
- [ ] Semantic search using embeddings comparison
- [ ] Topic overlap detection between users
- [ ] Collaboration opportunity discovery
- [ ] Real-time collaboration session management
- [ ] Progress tracking and analytics

**Phase 5: Trust & Safety**
- [ ] Comprehensive audit logging
- [ ] Automated data purging systems
- [ ] Security monitoring
- [ ] GDPR compliance tools

### ðŸ’­ OPEN QUESTIONS
1. Embedding Strategy: OpenAI embeddings vs self-hosted for privacy?
2. Real-time vs async collaboration workflows?
3. File type scope for Google Drive (Docs, Sheets, PDFs)?
4. Matching algorithm: Pure AI vs user-defined keywords?
